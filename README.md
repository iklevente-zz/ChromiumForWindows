# Chromium For Windows
This project can install the latest pure Chromium to your PC and it keeps the browser up to date.

Every time you run Chromium it checks for a newer version and if needed it will update it in seconds without you noticing anything,

**In short: You can use the fastest, stable, pure Chromium to satisfy your needs.**

Check the [Releases](https://github.com/iklevente/ChromiumForWindows/releases) page for the latest Installer.

## Plans:

 - x86 support
 - Set as Default Browser support ‚úÖ
 - Kill Chrome process to be able to update ‚úÖ
 - Change version checker to https://github.com/Hibbiki/chromium-win64/releases/latest/
 - Download chromium from: https://github.com/Hibbiki/chromium-win64/releases/latest/download/mini_installer.sync.exe ‚úÖ
 - This means I am planning to make this updater compatible with Hibbiki's Chromium installer. It will download the latest stable Chromium with Google API keys, widevine support and all-codecs support.
