# Chromium For Windows
This project can install the latest pure Chromium to your PC and it keeps the browser up to date.

Every time you run Chromium it checks for a newer version and if needed it will update it in seconds without you noticing anything,

**In short: You can use the fastest, bleeding-edge, pure Chromium to satisfy your needs. Without Google's implemented spyware.**

Check the [Releases](https://github.com/iklevente/ChromiumForWindows/releases) page for the latest Installer.

## Plans:

 - x86 support
 - Set as Default Browser support
 - Kill Chrome process to be able to update
 - Change version checker to http://commondatastorage.googleapis.com/chromium-browser-snapshots/Win/LAST_CHANGE (Less updates (eg.: not 4 times a day, only 1 times a day), but will guarantee faster load times.)
