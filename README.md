# Chromium For Windows
This project can install the latest pure Chromium to your PC and it keeps the browser up to date.

Every time you run Chromium it checks for a newer version and if needed it will update it in seconds without you noticing anything,

**In short: You can use the fastest, bleeding-edge, pure Chromium to satisfy your needs. Without Google's implemented spyware.**

Check the [Releases](https://github.com/iklevente/ChromiumForWindows/releases) page for the latest Installer.

## Plans:
