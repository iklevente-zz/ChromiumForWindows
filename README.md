# Chromium For Windows
This project can install the latest Chromium on your PC and it keeps the browser up to date. The build releases are from https://chromium.woolyss.com/

**Important: You will need .NET Core Runtime to run the program. Download it from [here](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download).**

Every time you start your computer, it checks for a newer version and if needed it will update it in seconds.

**In short: You can use the fastest, stable, pure Chromium to satisfy your needs.**

Check the [Releases](https://github.com/iklevente/ChromiumForWindows/releases/latest) page for the latest Installer.
