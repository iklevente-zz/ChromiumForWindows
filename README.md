# Chromium For Windows
This project can install the latest Chromium to your PC and it keeps the browser up to date. It is based on [Hibbiki's Chromium builds](https://github.com/Hibbiki/chromium-win64).
Widevine, synchronisation and all-codecs are enabled.

The ungoogled version is based on [Marmaduke's Chromium builds](https://github.com/macchrome/winchrome/).
Widevine, and all-codecs+ are enabled. Sync disabled.
**Update:** Marmaduke switched back to the original release name, so Ungoogled installer was fixed/updated in 1.5.3 release on **22/09/2020**.

**Important: You will need .NET Core Runtime to run the program. Download it from [here](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download).**

Every time you run Chromium it checks for a newer version and if needed it will update it in seconds.

**In short: You can use the fastest, stable, pure Chromium to satisfy your needs.**

Check the [Releases](https://github.com/iklevente/ChromiumForWindows/releases/latest) page for the latest Installer.

## Plans:
- Keep the project working as expected, if something would go wrong.
- Material UI Installer
- Ability to choose from the Chromium builds (eg.: ungoogled, raw build...)
- Add support for Windows flags
- Jumplist at taskbar
- Merge the updater appid with Chromium to get rid of duplicated icons on taskbar
