# Chromium For Windows

**Remineder: The ungoogled version is only 85% done. It will be ready in a few days and it will work as expected.**

This project can install the latest Chromium to your PC and it keeps the browser up to date. It is based on [Marmaduke's Chromium builds](https://github.com/macchrome/winchrome/).
Widevine, and all-codecs+ are enabled. Sync disabled.

**Important: You will need .NET Core Runtime to run the program. Download it from [here](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download).**

Every time you run Chromium it checks for a newer version and if needed it will update it in seconds.

**In short: You can use the fastest, stable, pure Chromium to satisfy your needs.**

Check the [Releases](https://github.com/iklevente/ChromiumForWindows/releases) page for the latest Installer.

- Material UI Installer
- Ability to choose from the Chromium builds (eg.: ungoogled, raw build...)
- Add support for Windows flags
- Jumplist at taskbar
- Merge the updater appid with Chromium to get rid of duplicated icons on taskbar
